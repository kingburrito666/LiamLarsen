                    The course introduces software techniques in a Unix-style environment, using scripting languages and
                    a machine-oriented programming language (C). By the end of the course students should be able to use
                    existing and create new software tools, implement forks and pipes, signals and sockets, and feel
                    comfortable with shell scripting.

                    This course introduces students to the theory and application of algorithms and data
                    structures. Students learn the fundamental paradigms of algorithm design including greedy,
                    divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and backtracking, and the benefits of using
                    data structures such as stacks, queues, lists, heaps and hash tables. Common application
                    areas are considered including sorting, graph traversal, string searching, and
                    computational geometry. Students analyze algorithms using big-Oh notation and write
                    implementations in C.

                <p>
                    This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts of computer science, both as
                    a prelude to further study in the discipline and to serve broader educational goals. The
                    course uses Python, a high-level, portable, and well-constructed computer programming
                    language to demonstrate those concepts. The focus is on data types and control structures,
                    functions, recursion, and iteration - all this by solving real-life problems the 'Pythonian'
                    way.
