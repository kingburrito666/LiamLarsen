    <h2>College and Education</h2>
    <p>
        After completing a year at the "arts" high school 'LACHSA' for theatre, I had dropped out in pursuit of greater control over my education.
        The conventional high school educational system is deeply flawed, and lacks any sort of computer science or technologically based curriculum; everything is inefficient.
        I then did what is legally considered homeschooling. While completing the necessary tenth grade coursework, I began learning computer science, programming, and data analysis on my free time (of which I had a lot).
        I left home at 15 years old (after tenth grade) to attend two years at <a href="simons-rock.edu">Bard College at Simon's Rock</a>, a small college (that accepts students early) in the Berkshires of Massachusetts where I received my Associate of Arts Degree.
        Since then I have been building up my skills and resume in regards to graphic design, 3D-Modeling, and data analysis; something that University was forestalling.

    <h2>Time Log and Efficiency Ethic</h2>
    <p>
        Creating a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cj-hJ3VXzEMalC0IMs-uH79rQqTwzcbAWobNdLmi7ew/edit?usp=sharing">Time Log</a> and
        tracking every hour has immensely changed my work habits and usage of time. Being able to visualize and map out my days has given me the ability
        to change my habits for the better. I'm able to perpetuate habits that increase productively used time, and decrease those which reduce it.
        It allows me to stick to a very consecutive and rigorous schedule as the case with finals in University; one can see the amount of sleep
        decrease substantially, as "school work" hours skyrocket. I've learned and basically trained myself to do tasks in hour windows. If I'm close to finishing a task,
        or starting a new one, I'll wait till the next hour window; this reduces error in the spreadsheet, simultaneously tuning my internal "hour clock."
        About 4 times a day I'll fill in previous hours, varying from +/- 8 hours from previous log.
        Filling out hours is easy, as it remains a pinned tab in the browser, or access from the app if away from the computer for long periods of time.
        The Time Log has remained crucial for creating an efficient lifestyle for myself, and I would'nt give it up anytime soon; it has simply become a
        beneficial habit, of which I devote very little brainpower.
