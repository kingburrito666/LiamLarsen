        <h2>Should all data be open source?</h2>
        <p>
        Should the intellectual property theft be enforced
        over the Internet? Although I do believe what is created here should be free and
        open to anyone who wants to edit, redistribute, or create
        their own version of a product, many people would dissagree with me.

      The creation of software is a long and difficult task (of course
       depending on what you’re making). However, when that software is
        copy-written it limits who can continue to create it. It sets
         boundaries on the software’s potential. This is limiting the
          innovation that it could have. Furthermore, websites like Github
           and projects using Arduino/ Raspberry-Pi are completely open source.
            Everything created using them is open to the public and you are able
             to create your own versions of whatever that may be. This creates a
              giant pool of innovation, hundreds of people coming together; collaborating
               to create something that benefits people is astonishing. It really is the future.

        Since the creation of the Internet, open source is becoming more and more popular.
         Huge companies like Google create open source projects such as the Android operating system.
          Open source has led to websites like Wikipedia which combine knowledge with an open source
           library for developing more Wikipedia websites. You can learn, create, and build anything,
            and that’s whats so important about keeping software open source and why intellectual
             property rights limit a products potential. The innovation comes when people work together
              to create something free and open to everyone.
